#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n^3), while(a < n _ n _ n) => while(a < n^3),
the code will scale with respect to n^3.

b) O(n log n), there is a for loop which will run n times
and inside it a while loop which run until j is equal to
or greater than n, since j doubles everytime this makes it log n
n multiplied log n => O(n log n)

c) O(n), the bunnyEars function will run one time for each bunny(n) until
n reaches 0
